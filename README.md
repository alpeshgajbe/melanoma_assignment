# Skin Lesion Classification Using a Custom CNN

> This project aims to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model capable of accurately detecting various types of skin lesions, including melanoma, from image data. By alerting dermatologists to potentially malignant lesions, the model can aid in early detection, thereby reducing manual diagnostic efforts and improving patient outcomes.

## General Information
- **Background:** Melanoma is a dangerous form of skin cancer accounting for a significant portion of skin cancer-related deaths. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment.
- **Business Problem:** Dermatologists spend a considerable amount of time manually analyzing skin lesion images. By automating preliminary screening, this project aims to expedite the detection of melanoma and other skin lesions, enabling professionals to focus on high-risk cases faster.
- **Dataset Used:** The dataset consists of 2357 images of nine different classes of skin lesions (such as melanoma, nevus, and keratosis). The images are from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). They were pre-sorted into relevant categories and split into training and validation sets.

## Conclusions
- **Conclusion 1:** A custom CNN architecture was successfully trained to classify images into nine classes.  
- **Conclusion 2:** Initial results showed signs of overfitting. Data augmentation and regularization techniques helped improve the modelâ€™s generalization capability.  
- **Conclusion 3:** Balancing the dataset with the Augmentor library improved validation performance for underrepresented classes.  
- **Conclusion 4:** Even with improvements, continuous tuning (e.g., more augmentation, regularization) is needed for more robust performance and higher validation accuracy.
